    "    <li> You cannot rely on training loss getting low -- what you really want is the validation loss to go down, or validation accuracy to go up. And indeed - in some cases people train until validation accuracy reaches a threshold, or -- commonly known as \"early stopping\" -- until the validation accuracy starts to go down, which is a sign of over-fitting.\n",

Especially in NLP, you can often continue training for months and the model will continue getting slightly and slightly better. This is also the reason why it's hard to just stop at a threshold -- unless there's an external customer setting the threshold, why stop, where do you put the threshold?\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Stopping after a certain number of steps has the advantage that you know how long your training will take - so you can keep some sanity and not train for months. You can then try to get the best performance within this time budget. Another advantage is that you can fix your learning rate schedule -- e.g., lower the learning rate at 10% before finish, and then again more at 1% before finishing. Such learning rate schedules help a lot, but are harder to do if you don't know how long you're training.\n",
